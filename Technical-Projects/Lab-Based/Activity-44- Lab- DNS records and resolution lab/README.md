Activity-44- Lab- DNS records and resolution lab

# DNS Records Analysis and Name Resolution Lab

## Objective
Understand how Domain Name System (DNS) records function and how they are queried to resolve domain names into network resources.

## Lab Overview
This lab focuses on performing DNS queries to analyze common DNS record types and understand their role in internet communication. The lab simulates how analysts investigate DNS configurations and identify misconfigurations or suspicious behavior.

## Key Concepts Covered
- DNS resolution process
- Record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT
- Record priorities and mappings
- DNS query structure and responses

## Skills Demonstrated
- DNS analysis and interpretation
- Understanding domain-to-IP mappings
- Identifying potential DNS misconfigurations
- Applying DNS knowledge to security investigations

## Security Relevance
DNS is frequently leveraged in phishing, command-and-control communication, and traffic redirection. Understanding DNS records is essential for SOC analysts and cybersecurity professionals when investigating suspicious domains or network activity.
