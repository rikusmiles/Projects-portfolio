Activity-46- Lab- HTTP Methods and request analysis

# HTTP Methods, Requests, and API Interaction Lab

## Objective
Understand how different HTTP methods are used to interact with web applications and APIs, and how these interactions impact security.

## Lab Overview
This lab explores common HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE by interacting with web endpoints. The focus is on understanding request structure, parameters, and server responses from a security analysis perspective.

## Key Concepts Covered
- HTTP request and response lifecycle
- Common HTTP methods and use cases
- URL parameters and request bodies
- Client-server interaction fundamentals

## Skills Demonstrated
- HTTP traffic analysis
- Understanding REST-style interactions
- Identifying improper method usage
- Applying HTTP knowledge to security testing

## Security Relevance
Improper handling of HTTP methods can lead to unauthorized actions, data exposure, or API abuse. This lab builds foundational skills required for SOC analysis, vulnerability assessment, and web security testing.
