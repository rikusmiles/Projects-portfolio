Activity-45- Lab- Web directory Enumeration with Gobuster

# Web Directory Enumeration and Exposure Discovery Lab

## Objective
Identify hidden directories and exposed endpoints within a web application using directory enumeration techniques.

## Lab Overview
This lab demonstrates how attackers and security testers discover unintended or misconfigured web paths that may expose sensitive functionality. Using a wordlist-based enumeration approach, the lab highlights risks associated with insecure web deployment.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Directory and file enumeration
- HTTP response codes interpretation
- Attack surface discovery
- Importance of access controls

## Skills Demonstrated
- Web application reconnaissance
- Command-line security tooling usage
- Identifying exposed administrative or sensitive paths
- Risk identification and reporting mindset

## Security Relevance
Directory enumeration is a common initial step in web application attacks. Understanding this technique helps defenders identify exposed endpoints, reduce attack surfaces, and improve secure configuration practices.
