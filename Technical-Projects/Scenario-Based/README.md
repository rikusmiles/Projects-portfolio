# Scenario-Based Cybersecurity Projects

This section contains **scenario-driven cybersecurity projects** based on real-world incidents, enterprise environments, and industry-aligned use cases. These projects focus on **analysis, decision-making, documentation, and response strategy**, rather than tool execution alone.

## Scope of Work
- Incident Response (IR) case studies
- Vulnerability Assessment (VA) & Security Assessment reports
- Consolidated cybersecurity playbooks
- Threat modeling and attack scenario analysis
- Blue team response planning and escalation workflows

## Types of Projects Included
- Incident Response scenarios (ransomware, phishing, insider threat, malware)
- Vulnerability assessment reports with risk analysis
- Security posture evaluation case studies
- IR playbooks and standard operating procedures (SOPs)
- Threat and attack-chain walkthroughs (MITRE ATT&CK aligned)

## Skills & Concepts Demonstrated
- Incident response lifecycle (Preparation → Detection → Containment → Recovery)
- Risk assessment and prioritization
- Security documentation and reporting
- Threat intelligence interpretation
- Business impact analysis and remediation planning

## Tools & Frameworks Referenced
- MITRE ATT&CK
- NIST Incident Response Framework
- CVSS & vulnerability scoring models
- SIEM alert interpretation (conceptual)
- Security assessment methodologies

📌 **Focus:** Strategic thinking, analytical depth, and real-world security decision making.
